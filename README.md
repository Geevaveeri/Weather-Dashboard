I built a weather dashboard that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I used the OpenWeather One Call API to retieve the data dor cities. The search history gets saved and when you click on a city from the history it will fill in the weather information for that city once again. There is a section for the current day's weather and another section for a 5 day forcast. There are icons based on the type of weather and the UV index changes colors depnding on the severity of the rating.
